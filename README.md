# LAB-AREP-SECURE-APP

#Introduction

In this repository is a solution to the laboratory 7 of business architectures, we made a secure application in 
all its fronts and ensure both authorization and authentication and accounting, we built a spark service that will be responsible for authenticating the respective users
and in addition I use the model of 12 steps to increase the security of our application, we generate the keystore with this model, the certificates and the truststore that 
were shared between the two services, the login service and sample service.



## Architecture

The architecture was defined in class and we can see an image of it below:


## Run the app

The application is not running at the moment, however a video was made demonstrating the operation and the source code information was saved
in two different repositories

  -Login Service
  
  -Logic Service (example)
